# ðŸ§  LeetCode Solutions

Welcome! This repo contains my personal solutions to a variety of coding problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), implemented in **Java**, **TypeScript**, and **JavaScript**.

Each solution focuses on:
- Writing clean and readable code
- Understanding the underlying logic, not just passing test cases
- Learning and applying common DSA patterns (sliding window, two pointers, etc.)

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

/java/
Contains Java solutions (*.java files)

/typeScript-javaScript/
TypeScript/JavaScript solutions (*.ts/ *.js files)


## ðŸ”§ Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings
- Hashing & Sets
- Sliding Window
- Sorting & Binary Search
- Linked Lists
- Heaps & Priority Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Greedy, DP, and more

## ðŸš€ Why This Repo?

To build muscle memory through consistent practice â€” and to serve as a future reference whenever I revisit a problem or concept.

Feel free to explore. Contributions & discussions are welcome!
